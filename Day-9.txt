Switch Case:

if several options are available then it is not recommended to use if-else we should go for switch statement. because it improves readability of the code.


Syntax:

switch(ch){
case 1:
action-1;
break;
case 2:
action-2;
break;
case 3:
action-3;
break;
------
------
case n:
action-n;
break;
default:
}


Note:

until 1.4 version the allow types for the switch argument are byte, short, int, char but from 1.5 version on wards corresponding wrapper classes (Byte, Short, Character, Integer)
